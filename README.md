# Celestial Bodies Database - freeCodeCamp Project

This repository contains my solution to the "Build a Celestial Bodies Database" project from freeCodeCamp's Relational Database certification.  It demonstrates relational database design principles and SQL skills using PostgreSQL.

## Project Overview  
This database was created as a solution to the "Build a Celestial Bodies Database" project from freeCodeCamp's Relational Database certification. It includes the following tables:  
- **galaxy**: Stores information about galaxies, including their size and type.  
- **star**: Contains data about stars, including their age and galaxy association.  
- **planet**: Holds information about planets, such as distance from Earth and habitability.  
- **moon**: Stores details about moons, including their radius and parent planet.  
- **space_object**: A flexible table for storing information about other space objects, like comets, black holes, and space probes.  

The tables are connected through foreign key relationships to represent the hierarchical structure of celestial bodies, allowing efficient querying and data integrity.

## Features  
- **Relational Database Design**: Proper use of primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and represent real-world relationships.  
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Normalized schema to reduce redundancy and ensure efficient data retrieval.  
- **PostgreSQL Usage**: The database is designed and implemented using PostgreSQL, leveraging its powerful features for relational databases.  

## Learning Objectives  
This project demonstrates the following skills:  
- Relational database design and normalization  
- Creating tables with appropriate data types and constraints  
- Establishing foreign key relationships for data integrity  
- Writing complex SQL queries for data retrieval
